<td>The playing field is a rectangular area with dimensions and zones as shown above.</td>
<td>Each team will put a maximum of seven players on the field during each point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The playing field should be essentially flat, free of obstructions and afford reasonable player safety.</td>
<td>The minimum is a count of five players on the field during each point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The perimeter lines surround the playing field and consist of two sidelines along the length and two endlines along the width.</td>
<td>Each team must designate a captain and a spirit captain to represent the team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field.</td>
<td>A team may make unlimited substitutions after a goal is scored and before their team signals readiness for the pull.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The goal lines are the lines that separate the central zone from the end zones and are part of the central zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The immediate surroundings of the playing field shall be kept clear of movable objects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>If play is obstructed by non-players or objects within three metres of the perimeter line, any obstructed player or thrower in possession may call “Violation”.</td>
